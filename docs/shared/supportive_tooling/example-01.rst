Example-01
==========

Let use pick up again the example we used in getting started and assume we locally stored information about the Heart of Gold Spacecraft Crew as Comma Separated Values:

.. csv-table:: persons.csv
   :file: _static/test-data/persons.csv
   :widths: 10, 10, 10, 10, 10
   :header-rows: 1

We will now guide you through the process of how to represent this data file as linked data in openMINDS using the openMINDS Python library.
