Research products
#################

openMINDS supports the representation of various research products (e.g., datasets from human, animal or simulation studies, computational models, software tools). All research products are versioned, have a common set of bibliographic properties, and (typically) link to the file repository where data are stored.

Understanding research product versioning
#########################################

openMINDS distinguishes between a conceptual (version-independent) research product and it's respective research product version(s).  

A **research product** is composed of metadata that are typically valid across all versions (e.g., title, abstract, homepage).  

A **research product version** can inherit or overwrite all version-independent metadata, and is additionally composed of metadata that are typically version-specific (e.g., studied specimen, used technique). 


Registration of file repositories
#################################

openMINDS allows to register data from a file repository in three levels of detail: 

**Level-01:** Registration of a general pointer to a file repository.  

**Level-02:** Registration of a general pointer to a file repository, and individual pointers to all data files within this repository.  

**Level-03:** Registration of a general pointer to a file repository, individual pointers to all data files within this repository, and grouping of those data files into customized file bundles. 


Making use of research projects
###############################

openMINDS supports the grouping of different research products into a joint research project (e.g. to capture collaborative work).
