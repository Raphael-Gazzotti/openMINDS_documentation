#######################################
Welcome to the openMINDS documentation!
#######################################

**openMINDS** is a metadata framework for linked data. The framework comprises:

- `Schema specifications <schema_specifications.html>`_ for multiple, interlocked metadata models
- `Instance libraries <instance_libraries.html>`_ for serviceable, well-defined terms and constructs
- `Supportive tooling <shared/supportive_tooling.html>`_ for handling openMINDS in Python or MATLAB

Applying the openMINDS framework to your own data collection, requires you to design a graph representation (linked data model) of your data. What this means and how to approach this challenge is described in `Getting started <shared/getting_started.html>`_.

.. note::

   This project is under active development. As an open-source project community contributions are highly appreciated (cf. `contribution guidelines <shared/contribution_guidelines.html>`_).
