Welcome to the openMINDS documentation!
#######################################

**openMINDS** is a metadata framework for graph database systems. The framework comprises:

- `Specifications <specifications.html>`_ of schemas for multiple, interlocked metadata models
- `Libraries <libraries.html>`_ for serviceable, well-defined terms and constructs
- `Supportive tooling <shared/supportive_tooling.html>`_ for handling openMINDS in Python or MATLAB

Applying the openMINDS framework to your own data collection, requires you to design a graph representation of your data. What this means and how to approach this challenge is described in `Getting started <shared/getting_started.html>`_.

.. note::
   This project is under active development. As an open-source project community contributions are highly appreciated (cf. `How to contribute <shared/how_to_contribute.html>`_).
