Supportive tooling
##################

The openMINDS framework develops and maintains a set of supportive tools that facilitate the usage of the metadata models and instance libraries for creating a linked data representation of your own research. 

Within this chapter, we will teach you how to work with openMINDS from a practical perspective by making use of the available supportive tools:
