This chapter offers an overview of the openMINDS metadata models from a practical perspective. 
Please note that this overview will by no means cover all annotation options the openMINDS metadata models offer.
However, we hope we can provide you with a good starting point to create an openMINDS metadata collection for your data.

The openMINDS metadata models are centered around research products:

| - **Dataset** (focus: data originating from human, animal or simulation experiment)
| - **Model** (focus: data and code defining a computational model)
| - **Software** (focus: data and code defining a software tool)
| - **MetaDataModel** (focus: data defining specifications of a data or metadata model)
| - **BrainAtlas** (focus: data defining a brain atlas)
| - **CommonCoordinatSpace** (focus: data defining a common coordinate space)
| - **LivePaper** (focus: data defining a live paper)
| - **WorkflowRecipe** (focus: data and code defining the recipe of a computational workflow)
| - **WebService** (focus: data and code defining a web service)

.. note::
   Please be aware that early openMINDS versions (\â‰¤ v2.0) only support a reduced list of research products.
