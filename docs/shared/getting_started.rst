This chapter will teach you fundamental knowledge for making use of the openMINDS metadata framework.
We will dig into JSON-LD as linked (meta)data format and provide you with a conceptual overview of how to represent your research as linked (meta)data in openMINDS.  

If you are already familiar with linked data, you can also directly jump to our practical introduction for applying openMINDS (cf. `supportive tooling <supportive_tooling.html>`_).
