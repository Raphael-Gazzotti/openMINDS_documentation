This chapter will teach you fundamental knowledge for making use of the openMINDS metadata framework.
We will dig into the concept of linked data using JSON-LD and provide you with a conceptual overview of how to represent your data in openMINDS.  

If you are already familiar with linked data, you can also directly jump to our practical introduction for applying openMINDS (cf. `supportive tooling <supportive_tooling.html>`_).
