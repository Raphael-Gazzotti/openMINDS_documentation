This chapter offers an overview of the openMINDS metadata models from a practical perspective. 
Please note that this overview will by no means cover all annotation options the openMINDS metadata models offer.
However, we hope we can provide you with a good starting point to create an openMINDS metadata collection for your data.

Basics

openMINDS provides schema specifications for metadata models that are tailored for data representations in graph databases.
Information in graph databases is represented in **nodes** that are linked via **edges**. 

openMINDS currently supports the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommendation for `JSON-LD <https://json-ld.org/>`_ \(JavaScript Object Notation for Linked Data\) to encode linked metadata instances.

Let us assume the following simplified openMINDS schema specification for defining a person in JSON-Schema:

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "$id": "https://openminds.ebrains.eu/core/person?format=json-schema",
     "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
     "properties": {
       "@id": {
         "type": "string"
       },
       "@type": {
         "type": "string"
       },
       "https://openminds.ebrains.eu/vocab/familyName": {
         "type": "string"
       },
       "https://openminds.ebrains.eu/vocab/givenName": {
         "type": "string"
       }
     },
     "required": [
       "@id",
       "@type",
       "https://openminds.ebrains.eu/vocab/givenName"
     ],
     "type": "object"
   }

The respectively correct serialization of this schema in JSON-LD would be the following:

.. example-code::

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "@id": "https://localhost/person_zehl_lyuba.jsonld",
     "@type": "https://openminds.ebrains.eu/core/Person",
     "https://openminds.ebrains.eu/vocab/familyName": "Zehl",
     "https://openminds.ebrains.eu/vocab/givenName": "Lyuba"
   }

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "@context": {
       "@vocab": "https://openminds.ebrains.eu/vocab/"
     },
     "@id": "https://localhost/person_zehl_lyuba.jsonld",
     "@type": "https://openminds.ebrains.eu/core/Person",
     "familyName": "Zehl",
     "givenName": "Lyuba"
   }

*****************
Research products
*****************

The openMINDS metadata models are centered around research products:

| - **Dataset** (focus: data originating from human, animal or simulation experiment)
| - **Model** (focus: data and code defining a computational model)
| - **Software** (focus: data and code defining a software tool)
| - **MetaDataModel** (focus: data defining specifications of a data or metadata model)
| - **BrainAtlas** (focus: data defining a brain atlas)
| - **CommonCoordinatSpace** (focus: data defining a common coordinate space)
| - **LivePaper** (focus: data defining a live paper)
| - **WorkflowRecipe** (focus: data and code defining the recipe of a computational workflow)
| - **WebService** (focus: data and code defining a web service)

.. note:: Note
   Please be aware that early openMINDS versions (\â‰¤ v2.0) only support a reduced list of research products.
