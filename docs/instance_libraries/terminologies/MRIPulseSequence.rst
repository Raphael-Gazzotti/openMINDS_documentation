   :@id: https://openminds.om-i.org/instances/MRIPulseSequence/echoPlanarPulseSequence
   :@type: https://openminds.om-i.org/types/MRIPulseSequence
   :definition: In magnetic resonance imaging, an 'echo-planar pulse sequence' is a contrasting technique where each radio frequency field (RF) excitation is followed by a train of gradient echoes with different spatial encoding allowing for very rapid scanning. [adapted from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics_of_magnetic_resonance_imaging#Echo-planar_imaging)]

   :definition: A gradient echo pulse sequence that combines a low-flip angle radio-frequency excitation of the nuclear magnetic resonance signal (recorded as a spatially encoded gradient echo) with a short repetition time.

.. admonition:: metadata sheet

   :@id: https://openminds.om-i.org/instances/MRIPulseSequence/gradientEchoPulseSequence
   :@type: https://openminds.om-i.org/types/MRIPulseSequence
   :definition: In magnetic resonance imaging, a 'gradient-echo pulse sequence' is a contrast generation technique that rapidly induces bulk changes in the spin magnetization of a sample by applying a series of carefully constructed pulses so that the change in the gradient of the magnetic field is maximized, trading contrast for speed (cf. [Hargreaves (2012)](https://doi.org/10.1002/jmri.23742)).

   :@type: https://openminds.om-i.org/types/MRIPulseSequence
   :definition: In magnetic resonance imaging, a 'spin echo pulse sequence' is a contrast generation technique that induces bulk changes in the spin magnetization of a sample by applying sequential pulses of resonant electromagnetic waves at different angles (cf. [Fonseca (2013)](https://doi.org/10.5772/53693)).
