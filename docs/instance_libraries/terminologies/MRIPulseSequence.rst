   :@type: https://openminds.ebrains.eu/controlledTerms/MRIPulseSequence
   :definition: In magnetic resonance imaging, a 'T1 pulse sequence' is a contrasting technique that allows the magnetization of the specimen or object to recover (spin-lattice relaxation) before measuring the magnetic resonance signal by changing the repetition time. [adapted from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRI_sequence)]

   :definition: In magnetic resonance imaging, a 'T2 pulse sequence' is a contrasting technique that allows the magnetization of the specimen or object to decay (spin-spin relaxation) before measuring the magnetic resonance signal by changing the echo time.

   :definition: In magnetic resonance imaging, an 'echo-planar pulse sequence' is a contrasting technique where each radio frequency field (RF) excitation is followed by a train of gradient echoes with different spatial encoding allowing for very rapid scanning.

   :@type: https://openminds.ebrains.eu/controlledTerms/MRIPulseSequence
   :definition: In magnetic resonance imaging, a 'gradient-echo pulse sequence' is a contrast generation technique that rapidly induces bulk changes in the spin magnetization of a sample by applying a series of carefully constructed pulses so that the change in the gradient of the magnetic field is maximized, trading contrast for speed (cf. [Hargreaves (2012)](https://doi.org/10.1002/jmri.23742)).
