   :KnowledgeSpace entry: -
   :description: The Knowledge Graph Search User Interface makes data, models and software discoverable and easy to use. The user interface allows for free text searches and provides filters to narrow searches based on metadata that classifies data according to experimental method, data modality and species among other options. The query results are displayed as Dataset cards containing key information about the dataset, e.g. its metadata, terms of use, and how to cite and reuse the data. Datasets that have undergone spatial registration to an atlas contain links to 3D or 2D viewers for navigating the data in atlas space.

   :KnowledgeSpace entry: -
   :description: Digital reconstructions are a parsimonious and efficient representation of neuronal morphology. They allow extensive analysis and implementation of biophysical models of electrophysiology. However, reconstructing cells is a very labor-intensive and time-consuming process. A collection of such data is an invaluable resource for the neuroscience community. This inventory is meant to encourage data sharing among neuroscientists, enabling further use of this data and to prevent data loss.
