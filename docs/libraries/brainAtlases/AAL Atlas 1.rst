   :description: The AAL1 atlas comprises an anatomical parcellation of the spatially normalized single-subject high-resolution T1 volume (Colin27, 2008) provided by the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) which can be used to automatically label individual subject brains of functional studies. The MNI single-subjectmain sulci were first delineated and further used as landmarks for the 3D definition of 45 anatomical volumes of interest (AVOI) in each hemisphere. This procedure was performed using a dedicated software which allowed a 3D following of the sulci course on the edited brain. Regions of interest were then drawn manually with the same software every 2mm on the axial slices of the high-resolution MNI single subject. The 90 AVOI were reconstructed and assigned a label. For automated anatomical labelling of functional studies according to this parcellation method, three procedures are proposed: (1) labelling of an extremum defined by a set of coordinates; (2) percentage of voxels belonging to teach of the AVOI intersected by a sphere centered by a set of coordinates; (3) percentage of voxels belonging to each of the AVOI intersected by an activated cluster. An interface with the Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) packages is provided as a freeware to researchers of the neuroimaging community to conduct the automated labelling procedures.
